# line each: OK (below 35000), SOFT-BREACH (35000 to 40000), CROP-REQUIRED (above 40000). Also lists
# every completed register entry (## checkmark heading) not yet archived (COMPLETED-NOT-ARCHIVED,
# v3.6.1: the marker is legal, the unfinished close-out is the finding), reports the
# standing-blocker section character count separately, and reports the Pinned Directives
# block character count separately (v3.2, the root CLAUDE.md crop-exemption class).
# Advisory: always exits 0.

# Count Unicode code points, not bytes and not UTF-16 units, so one astral character (an emoji)
# costs 1 against the ceiling on every platform. Reads stdin. `wc -m` cannot be used: under LC_ALL=C
# it degenerates to byte counting (an emoji costs 4), and on builds with a 16-bit wchar_t
# (Git for Windows) even a UTF-8 locale yields UTF-16 units (an emoji costs 2). Stripping UTF-8
# continuation bytes (0x80 to 0xBF) leaves exactly one byte per code point, with no locale dependency.
# A leading UTF-8 BOM is dropped first: Windows reads these files with Get-Content -Encoding utf8,
# which strips the BOM, so keeping it here would make the two platforms disagree by one character.
