# phaneslight-template v3.7.2 update-preflight
# The update-run fast-path aggregator: runs the sensors (census-diff, hook table, register
# breach state, manifest sha256 drift, module-list vs config, optional spec-version compare)
# and the git delta, and emits ONE JSON verdict {sensors, quiet, gitDelta}. quiet is true only
# on POSITIVE evidence of stasis: a sensor that cannot observe reports available:false and the
# verdict is NOT quiet, because unknown is not quiet. gitDelta is separate from quiet by
# contract: the session requires quiet AND gitDelta.available AND an empty changedFiles before
# taking the fast path. hook-verify folds in here: `update-preflight --hooks-only` prints just
# the hooks sensor (the standalone hook-verify form; same logic, one implementation).
# Optional: --spec-version <v> compares the RUNNING spec's version against the installed one;
# without it that sensor is reported not-provided and excluded from quiet (Step 0's own
# self-version check already covers it and is never skipped). Advisory: always exits 0.
#
# THE SHELL PART OF THIS FILE ENDS AT THE "# BEGIN NODE PROGRAM" MARKER. Everything after it is
# JavaScript, read out of this file by sed and piped to `node -`, and never parsed by the shell,
# which has exited before it gets there. `dash -n` on the whole file therefore fails by design;
# each half is checked by its own checker, `dash -n` on the shell prefix and `node --check` on
# the JavaScript suffix. The heredoc form this shape replaces delivered ZERO BYTES for any body
# of 4096 bytes or more on the target machine's dash, silently, which for an always-exit-0
# aggregator is indistinguishable from a clean report.
#
# POSIX notes, each a place where the Windows original could not be copied word for word:
#
#   1. The three sibling sensors are invoked as `sh <sibling>.sh`, not run in-process. The
#      Windows sibling calls `& census-diff.ps1` inside its own PowerShell session, so a crash
#      in the child surfaces there as a caught exception; here it surfaces as a non-zero exit
#      code. The verdict is taken from the EXIT CODE on both sides and never from the presence
#      of stderr text, so a sibling that chatters on stderr and exits 0 still reads as success.
#   2. Siblings resolve through PHANESLIGHT_HERE, exported below. __dirname does not exist under
#      `node -`, and process.argv[1] is the literal "-", so neither can stand in for the
#      Windows $PSScriptRoot.
#   3. Three "not installed" reason strings name the POSIX file: 'census-diff.sh not installed',
#      'register-check.sh not installed', 'module-list.sh not installed', where the Windows
#      sibling names the .ps1. The hooks sensor likewise tests for
#      .phaneslight/scripts/<hook>.sh where Windows tests for <hook>.ps1. These are the only
#      intended stdout differences between the two verdicts, they fire only on a project missing
#      the sibling scripts entirely, and naming the Windows file on a POSIX box would be a
#      statement the script cannot support.
#   4. Path identity is ORDINAL and case-sensitive throughout, because POSIX paths are. The
#      sha256 compare stays case-INSENSITIVE, matching the Windows OrdinalIgnoreCase compare:
#      Node's crypto emits lowercase hex where Get-FileHash emits uppercase, and a manifest may
#      carry either.
#   5. node is required. When it is absent this script still prints a WHOLE verdict, with no
#      sensors, quiet false and gitDelta unavailable, and still exits 0. An aggregator that
#      cannot look must say so in the shape its consumer already parses; it must never print
#      nothing, and a caller that parses nothing reads it as a clean fast path. That degrade
#      block is one heredoc of well under the 4095-byte ceiling measured on the target machine's
#      dash, and it is the only heredoc left in this file.

// node-parity JSON, and NOT JSON.stringify, for two measured reasons.
//
// 1. A plain JS object emits integer-like keys FIRST, in numeric order, whatever the insertion

//    by user paths, so a tracked file named 123 would move to the top and the two platforms
//    would write different bytes. Every user-keyed dictionary is therefore built as a Map and
//    emitted here in insertion order. A Map is the ONLY container in this codebase allowed to
//    carry user-supplied keys.
// 2. JSON.stringify escapes a lone surrogate as \udXXX where the Windows emitter writes the
//    code unit raw. Iterating code units and appending them keeps the two in step.
//
// Layout matches JSON.stringify(x, null, 2): two-space indent, "key": value, one element per
// line, {} and [] for empty. Numbers: every value these reports emit is an integer, so
// String(n) matches the Windows InvariantCulture conversion.

// unavailable shape is a sensor that was asked and FAILED, delta true, and gating on `available`
// swallowed it: measured on a compliant project, spec.delta was true and quiet was true in the
