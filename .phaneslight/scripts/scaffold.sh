# phaneslight-template v3.7.2 scaffold
# Mechanizes Phase 2.5 Steps 1, 1b, and 2: creates the documentation tree (under the
# configured docRoot), the tests tree, and the four verbatim README files, reading the README
# bodies from the installed prompt templates (.claude/template/readme-docs.md and
# readme-tests.md, SECTION blocks). Merge-never-overwrite: an EXISTING file or folder is never
# touched, only absent ones are created, and every creation is listed on stdout. CLAUDE.md and
# CLAUDE.local.md are deliberately NOT scaffold's to create: their blocks carry per-project
# judgment (Pinned Directives, capability register) and the session remains their writer.
# NOT advisory: exit 0 on success (including "nothing to do"); exit 1 when the project, config,
# or a required template cannot be read, or when a write fails (the session then falls back to
# writing the Step 1/1b/2 content from phaneslight.md directly). On a write failure the items already
# created ARE listed before the error: "nothing created" is achievable for every pre-write
# refusal and is NOT achievable once the eighth of nineteen writes fails, so the contract states
# what the script can actually guarantee rather than a promise it would break in silence.
#
# POSIX port notes. Each is a place where the Windows original leans on something sh does not
# have, and each is a deliberate decision rather than an omission:
#   1. Config malformation. Windows parses .phaneslight/config.json with ConvertFrom-Json and
#      refuses any malformation anywhere in the file. POSIX has no JSON parser, so the shared
#      cfg_key_bad gate is applied to docRoot, the single key this script consumes: present but
#      unreadable is a refusal, genuinely absent is the honest 'documentation' default.
#      Malformation in a region docRoot never touches still degrades to that default here. That
#      residual gap is the platform divergence the run skill records, not an oversight.
#   2. No BOM, by construction. Section bodies are written with printf, which emits those bytes
#      and nothing else, so the UTF8Encoding($false) the Windows script builds has no twin.
#   3. Get-Content hands the parser lines with the line terminator already removed, CR included.
#      The parser below therefore strips one trailing CR per line, so that a CRLF-damaged
#      template still produces byte-identical LF README bodies on both platforms.
#   4. IsPathRooted has no POSIX twin. A leading '/' is the POSIX definition of rooted. A
#      leading backslash and a drive-qualified prefix are refused with the SAME message even
#      though POSIX would read them as ordinary relative names, because letting them through
#      would silently create a directory literally named 'C:\docs' where Windows refuses.
#   5. Sections are held in shell variables named SEC_<file>_<section>, with '-' mapped to '_'.
#      That mapping is injective because a validated section name cannot contain '_' (see D5),
#      and shell variable names are case-sensitive, which is what makes the Ordinal lookup the
#      Windows side gets from New-OrdinalHashtable reachable here at all (D1).

# SECTION parser for the installed prompt templates. A missing or malformed template is a
# refusal naming the file: the fallback (authoring from the phaneslight.md verbatim blocks) is the
# session's judgment, not this script's.
# The parser was weak in five ways, and every one of them writes WRONG CONTENT at exit 0 rather
# than failing, which merge-never-overwrite then makes permanent: the bad file is never
# corrected on a later run, because a later run sees a file that already exists. That is what
# makes a parser bug here worse than a crash, and why all five refuse instead.
#   D1  section names were looked up case-insensitively, so a damaged template with the wrong
#       casing was silently accepted. Shell variable names are case-sensitive, which is the
#       POSIX form of the Ordinal hashtable the Windows script constructs.
#   D2  duplicate section names silently last-won.
#   D3  an END marker inside a fenced code block closed the section early: observed truncating
#       a body to a 33-byte stub.
#   D4  an empty section produced a 1-byte file.
#   D5  a marker whose name fell outside the [A-Za-z0-9-] charset was not recognized as a
#       marker at all, so the literal marker line shipped verbatim into the README.
# Returns 2 for missing or unreadable (the null of the Windows original), 1 for a parse defect
# with the message in GS_ERR (which the caller turns into a refusal naming the file), 0 on
# success with each body in SEC_<prefix>_<key>.

# subshell and every parsed section would be discarded at the closing 'done'. The
