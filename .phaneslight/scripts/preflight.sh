# phaneslight-template v3.7.2 preflight
# Phase 0 mechanical pre-flights, observed and reported, NEVER acted on: run-type marker,
# installed version, the four standard MCP servers via `claude mcp list`, platform,
# capability-census counts, and the legacy-migration signals. Emits ONE digest JSON. Consent,
# AskUserQuestion, MCP installs, the STOP-and-route-to-phaneslightupgrade judgment, and every
# other decision stay in the session: this script observes and never mutates anything.
# Advisory: always exits 0.
#
# THE SHELL PART OF THIS FILE ENDS AT THE "# BEGIN NODE PROGRAM" MARKER. Everything after it is
# JavaScript, read out of this file by sed and piped to `node -`, and never parsed by the shell,
# which has exited before it gets there. `dash -n` on the whole file therefore fails by design;
# each half is checked by its own checker, `dash -n` on the shell prefix and `node --check` on
# the JavaScript suffix. The heredoc form this shape replaces delivered ZERO BYTES for any body
# of 4096 bytes or more on the target machine's dash, silently, which for an always-exit-0
# sensor is indistinguishable from a clean report.
#
# POSIX notes, each a place where the Windows original could not be copied word for word:
#
#   1. platform is reported as "posix" where the Windows sibling reports "windows". That single
#      key is the ONLY intended difference between the two digests, and the differential harness
#      masks exactly that key and fails if it is absent on either side.
#   2. The Windows script keeps the loose-root walk in a "# BEGIN SHARED looseroot" region. There
#      is no POSIX twin of that region because preflight is its only consumer, so it is ported
#      here as a private function, findRootLoose, immediately below the shared node-core block.
#   3. Path identity is ORDINAL here. The Windows sibling compares paths OrdinalIgnoreCase under
#      its documented NTFS exception; POSIX paths are case-sensitive and a case-insensitive
#      compare would merge two genuinely different directories.
#   4. Get-ChildItem skips attribute-hidden entries. There is no such attribute on POSIX, so the
#      census counters and the CLAUDE.md sprawl walk see every entry. This is a divergence only
#      on a Windows filesystem, and only for an entry carrying the hidden attribute.
#   5. `*.md` is matched case-sensitively, because a POSIX glob is.
#   6. node is required. When it is absent this script still prints its WHOLE digest, with
#      runType "unknown", markerReadable and configReadable false, rootSource "none" and every
#      other value null, and still exits 0. A sensor that cannot look must say so in the shape
#      its consumer already parses; it must never print nothing, and it must never print zeros.
#      That degrade block is one heredoc of 798 bytes, comfortably inside the 4095-byte ceiling
#      measured on the target machine's dash, and it is the only heredoc left in this file.

// node-parity JSON, and NOT JSON.stringify, for two measured reasons.
//
// 1. A plain JS object emits integer-like keys FIRST, in numeric order, whatever the insertion
//    order was. annotated-files.json, state.files and the doc-index dictionaries are all keyed
//    by user paths, so a tracked file named 123 would move to the top and the two platforms
//    would write different bytes. Every user-keyed dictionary is therefore built as a Map and
//    emitted here in insertion order. A Map is the ONLY container in this codebase allowed to
//    carry user-supplied keys.
// 2. JSON.stringify escapes a lone surrogate as \udXXX where the Windows emitter writes the
//    code unit raw. Iterating code units and appending them keeps the two in step.
//
// Layout matches JSON.stringify(x, null, 2): two-space indent, "key": value, one element per
// line, {} and [] for empty. Numbers: every value these reports emit is an integer, so
// String(n) matches the Windows InvariantCulture conversion.

//
// The loose root, for preflight and preflight only: the one command that must also run against
// a project PhanesLight has NOT bootstrapped yet, where no .phaneslight/config.json exists.
// Strict root first, then a BOUNDED walk for a .claude directory, then the current directory.
//
// The walk is bounded because the unbounded version was the worst single defect in this set: it
// walked up into the user home and censused the whole machine as the project, reporting 6
// project commands and 12 CLAUDE.md files on an EMPTY fixture. Excluding one literal home
// string and SKIPPING that rung rather than stopping at it did not hold: the original signature
// was reproduced three separate ways, including a second .claude sitting above the excluded
// home.
//
// Four stop conditions replace the one exclusion:
//   1. depth cap of 24         A backstop, not a rule. It should never be the thing that stops a
//                              real walk, and if it ever is, source and stoppedBy say so.
//   2. the home directory      Stop. Resolved through homeDir(), which returns null rather than
//                              throwing, never by reading one environment string that can be
//                              unset or spelled differently from the walk's own spelling.
//   3. no parent               The filesystem root is never a project root, and it is refused
//                              WITHOUT testing the directory. On POSIX this is the bind-mount
//                              and chroot analogue of the Windows subst case: / can genuinely
//                              carry a .claude, so a no-parent check placed after the accept
//                              would never run.
//   4. .git in this directory  Stop after testing this level. Never walk out of a repository
//                              into its parent. This is also what protects a fresh project
//                              sitting under a directory that has grown its own .claude.
//
// EVERY refusing stop is evaluated BEFORE the accept, and that grouping is the whole design, not
// a style choice. A stop placed after the accept does not stop anything: the walk still ends on
// the forbidden directory, it just gets there by SUCCEEDING instead of by continuing, which is
// the original defect wearing a different shape. This was written the wrong way round twice on
// the Windows side and caught both times only by running it. Keep the stops together and above
// the accept, and the class cannot recur. The stop ORDER above is the source order and is
// preserved exactly: depth cap, home, no parent, then the accept, then .git.
