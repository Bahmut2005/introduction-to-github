# phaneslight-template v3.7.2 ledger
# Run-progress ledger mechanics (Phase 0 Compaction Survival made mechanical). Subcommands:
#   ledger append "<line>"  appends one caller-composed line (the caller owns the format;
#                           this script only writes; an argument containing CR or LF is
#                           refused, the ledger is line-oriented)
#   ledger status           prints CLOSED / OPEN <last line> / ABSENT / UNREADABLE
#   ledger close            appends the terminator line "CLOSED, run complete" (idempotent)
#   ledger reset            archives the ledger to run-progress.prev (one generation kept)
#                           and starts fresh (the mechanical arm of the consented fresh-run
#                           choice; the CONSENT stays in the session, decision B6)
# Advisory: always exits 0.
#
# Subcommand matching is case-sensitive on purpose (LG-2): `ledger RESET` must fall to the
# usage line below, not run the one subcommand here that destroys state. POSIX `case` is
# ordinal and case-sensitive by construction, which gives this for free with no extra guard,
# unlike the Windows form which needed an explicit -casesensitive switch.
