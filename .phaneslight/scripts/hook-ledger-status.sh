# phaneslight-template v3.7.2 hook-ledger-status
# SessionStart hook. Prints NOTHING when the run-progress ledger is closed or absent; prints
# exactly one line when a prior run died mid-flight, so the session opens knowing it must ask
# the user: resume, or start fresh (ledger reset). The ASKING stays in the session; this hook
# only surfaces the state. Run by hand with terminal stdin it exits 0 at once, never blocking.
# Always exits 0: unlike the PowerShell original there is no ErrorActionPreference to set, so
# the contract is kept the POSIX way instead, no `set -e` anywhere and every branch below ends
# in an explicit `exit 0` rather than relying on a caught exception.
TERMINATOR='CLOSED, run complete'

# The longest ledger line this hook will surface. HK-3 repair: the draft echoed the last line
# whatever its length, and a 300 KB line went straight into session-start context, which is the
# most expensive place in the whole system to put unbounded text. The cap is generous enough
# that a real phase line (date, phase, TODOs) is never touched.
